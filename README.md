<p>This folder includes three interesting and challenging projects from Modern Network Concepts course on Fall semester 2017 at University at Buffalo.</p>
<p>All three projects are written by Programming C language.<p>
<h2>First project: Text Chat Application</h2>
<p>The first project is to create a client-server architecture based text chat application involving up-to 4 clients concurrently using IO Multiplexing techniques.</p>
<p>Client functionalities include Unicast messaging, Broadcast messaging, and peer Blocking.</p>
<p>Server functionalities incude Message Relayed, Client information statistics</p>
<p>C and the BSD sockets API are used to implement this project.
<h2>Second project: Reliable Transport Protocols</h2>
<p> The second project to implement three reliable data transport protocols
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_bit_protocol">Alternating-Bit(ABT)</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Back-N_ARQ">Go-Back-N(GBN)</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Repeat_ARQ">Selective-Repeat(SR)</a>
to deal with data loss, data corruption and should deliver the data in order.
</p>
<h2>Third project: Software Defined Routing</h2>
<p> The third project is to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol">distance vector</a> routing protocol to build routing tables on 5 dedicated servers. 
</p>
<p> In addition to the routing protocol, the control plane also functioned as a controller agent to receive and respond to messages from/to a remote controller. </p>
